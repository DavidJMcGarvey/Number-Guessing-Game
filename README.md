# Treehouse Python Techdegree Project #01:
        THE NUMBER GUESSING GAME          
------------------------------------------

- This program first welcomes the user to the game and asks for the user's name.
- The user is then asked by name if they would like to play.
- If they choose to play, they will proceed to guess a number that has been randomly generated between 1-10 and will be given hints as to whether the random number is higher or lower than their guess.
- A high score will be given at the start of each game and will show the least amount of guesses taken to guess correctly from previous games.
- Exceptions will be caught and the user will be given understandable instructions on how to avoid them on the next try.
- After each game the user will be asked if they want to play again. Responding no here or at the initial welcome will prompt a goodbye statement and end the program.
